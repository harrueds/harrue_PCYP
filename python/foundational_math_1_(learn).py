**Learn Foundational Math 1 by Building an Equation Solver**<br>
Each of these steps will lead you toward the Certification Project. First you have to copy the files and set them up in your Google Drive.

# &darr; **Do this first** &darr;
Make sure you are logged into your Google account, and copy this notebook to your own account. Click "File" (at the top of this page) and then click "Save a copy in Drive."  The file will be in a folder called "Colab Notebooks" in your Google Drive.

#Directions - Click to expand the next step<br>
Click on the little <i>triangle</i> next to the word "Step" to do that step. Once you complete a step, click the triangle to expand the next step.

# Step 0 - Acquire the testing library

Please run this code to get the library file from FreeCodeCamp. Each step will use this library to test your code. You do not need to edit anything; just run this code cell and wait a few seconds until it tells you to go on to the next step.
"""

# You may need to run this cell at the beginning of each new session

!pip install requests

# This will just take a few seconds

import requests

# Get the library from GitHub
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/cdn/main/build/math-cert-tests/math-code-test-a.py'
r = requests.get(url)

# Save the library in a local working directory
with open('math_code_test_a.py', 'w') as f:

import math_code_test_a as test

# This will tell you if the code works
test.step19()

"""# Step 1 - Add

To help you get familiar with Colab notebooks, you will start with the basics. Python uses `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` for the four math operations: <i>add</i>, <i>subtract</i>, <i>multiply</i>, and <i>divide</i>. When you add two numbers, the result is the <i>sum</i>. Use addition within the `print` statement to get the sum of `a` and `b`. To run the code, you can hit "shift" and "enter" or you can click the run button (the triangle inside a circle).

"""# Step 2 - Subtract

When you subtract two numbers, the result is the <i>difference</i>. Use subtraction in the print statement to get the difference between `c` and `d`. Remember to use "shift" and "enter" to run the code.
"""

"""# Step 3 - Multiply

When you multiply numbers, the result is the <i>product</i>. Use multiplication within the print statement to get the product of `e` and `f`:
"""

e = 2

When you divide two numbers, the result is the <i>quotient</i>. Use division within the print statement to get the quotient of `g` and `h`:
"""

h = 4

# Change the next line
print(g / h)

import math_code_test_a as test

"""# Step 5 - Cast Input

User input comes in as a <i>string</i>, so you need to cast it as an <i>integer</i> or a <i>float</i> before doing any math. The code below asks for input and uses `int()` to cast it as an integer. Follow the model and cast the second variable as an integer. Then run the code an test it. (Remember to hit "enter" after you type each integer in the box.)

"""# Step 8 - Order of Operations

You may have heard of the <b>order of operations</b> and the acronym <b>PEMDAS</b>, which reminds you of the correct order. This means that you do what is in <b>Parentheses</b> first, then simplify <b>Exponents</b>. You then do all of the <b>Multiplication</b> and <b>Division</b> together, as long as you work from left to right and simplify them in order. The same is true of <b>Addition</b> and <b>Subtraction</b>: work from left to right and simplify the one the comes up next. Python knows the order of operations. In the following code, Python will calculate the actual_answer correctly. Notice the use of `**` to indicate an exponent. Do the arithmetic in your head (no writing code) and change the `your_answer` variable, then run the code to see if your_answer matches the actual_answer.

"""# Step 9 - Remainder and Modulus

A <i>remainder</i> is what is left over when you try to divide two numbers and it doesn’t divide evenly. The remainder of 10 / 4 is 2 because 4 goes into 10 two whole times, with 2 left over. The <i>modulus</i> (`%`) operator will output the remainder, so `10 % 4` will return 2. Use the modulus operator to find the remainder of a divided by b:

"""# Step 10 - Modulus and Factors

Use an `if` statement with the modulus operator to find out if one number is a factor of another. For example, to see if 5 is a factor of 20, you can test `if 20 % 5 == 0`. If there's no remainder, the second number is a factor of the first. Remember that Python comparisons use `==` to test values. Remember that the `if` statement ends in a colon (`:`) and the resulting block is indented four spaces. Finish the code below to print "true" if `test_factor` is a factor of `number` and print "false" if it is not.

A <i>prime</i> number is a number whose only factors are 1 and itself. The number 5 is prime because its only factors are 1 and 5, but the 6 is not prime because it has 1, 2, 3, and 6 as factors.

A *reciprocal* is a number "flipped." The reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $\frac{3}{2}$ and the reciprocal of 5 is $\frac{1}{5}$ because whole numbers have denominators of 1. You can multiply a number by its reciprocal to get 1, so 5 * $\frac{1}{5}$ = 1 and $\frac{2}{3}$ * $\frac{3}{2}$ = 1. To get the reciprocal of a number, take 1 divided by that number. Trying to get the reciprocal of zero will lead to a "divide by zero" error. Use a print statement to output the reciprocal of `n` as a decimal.

This step will combine a few things you have already done. Remember that a square number is an integer that is the result of multiplying another integer by itself.

For example, 2 is a factor of 16, but 2 is not a square number, while 4 is a factor and it is a square number, but it is not the greatest square factor. The greatest square factor of 16 is 16.
